            <h3 class="subtitle">What Are Valorant Agents?</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">What are Valorant agents? The characters in Valorant are called “agents”. New players only have access to five agents; Brimstone, Jett, Phoenix, Sage, and Sova.</p>

            <p class="article-content">The other agents are Breach, Cypher, Omen, Raze, Reyna, and Viper who are initially locked in the game. However, there are several ways to unlock these agents which will also be discussed in the section below.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Players get a sneak peek of each agent’s background and culture through in-game overview and voice lines.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Valorant agents each have four abilities. The fourth ability is known as the agent’s most powerful and effective skill – or it’s Ultimate.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">How Do Valorant Abilities Work?</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">It’s important to learn how Valorant abilities work. Each Valorant agent has four abilities that can be earned in different ways.</p>

            <p class="article-content">One signature ability is always free every round. Players can buy the other two abilities during the buying phase before the beginning of each round.</p>

            <p class="article-content">The ultimate ability is the hardest one to earn but has the most ways to earn it. The ultimate ability of each agent requires a different number of Ult points to activate.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Ult points are granted through capturing Ult orbs located on the map, dying in a round, planting the Spike, defusing the Spike, and killing an opponent.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Unused abilities are still available in the next round. However, guns, shields, abilities, and ult points are gone after switching roles at half time. Make sure that you use your ultimate ability before it’s gone or else you’ll lose all the Ult points you worked hard for.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Learning the right timing to use your abilities will take patience, time, and a lot of practice. For now, it’s okay to miss some shots as long as you keep the lessons along the way.  </p>

            <p class="article-content">Tier 5 and Tier 10 give free agents to unlock. If you have completed the ten tiers, you can activate contracts to earn experience points towards the next free agent. However, this will take a longer grinding than the previous two agents.</p>

            <p class="article-content">With that said, you should choose your first two agents wisely. The game automatically prompts you to recruit a new agent if you are eligible for one.</p>

            <p class="article-content">If you don’t have the time to invest in earning the rest of the agents, you can purchase each agent for 1000 Valorant points, which is equivalent to $12.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Agents are classified into four general roles; Duelists, Controllers, Initiators, and Sentinels.These agents specialized in a specific role within the game such as Support, Lurker, Entry Fragger, Leader, and Crowd Control.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">Valorant agents offer different roles and play styles. There is a unique pool of agents to choose from.</p>
