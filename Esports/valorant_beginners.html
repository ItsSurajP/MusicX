            <h1 id="title">A Beginner’s Guide To VALORANT</h1>
            
            <img class="entry-thumbnail" src="images/banner-news-1.jpg">
            <p class="article-content">VALORANT began its closed beta last week and there is no doubt that the game will be a hit. For players looking to dive into the newest tactical FPS, there is quite a bit of useful information to know in order to avoid simple mistakes and grow in skill. Comparisons online are being made to CS:GO, Overwatch, and other FPS games. In a sense, there are similarities or borrowed concepts, but VALORANT is ultimately a beast to learn in its own right. </p>

            <img class="article-image" src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/valorant-image-1-4.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5">

            <h3 class="subtitle">Core Gameplay And Objectives</h3>

            <p class="article-content">Two teams of five players face off on one of several maps, with the first team to win thirteen rounds taking the overall match victory. Similar to other FPS games, each team alternates between taking the role of Attacker or Defender. To win a round, all the Attackers need to do is plant the Spike (like a bomb in other titles) on one of several predetermined locations, or simply eliminate the opposing team. Likewise, the Defenders are only tasked with stopping the Spike plant by defusing it within the round time limit or by eliminating the opposition. </p>

            <img class="article-image" src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/valorante-image-2.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5">

            <h3 class="subtitle">Buying Weapons Strategically</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">At the start of each round, players will have a moment to spend their Creds (the in-game currency) to purchase weapons, armor, and abilities. This is called the Buy Phase, and the number of Creds available is directly related to securing certain actions in the previous round. Dying right away will award only a small number of Creds, whereas eliminating opponents, winning the round, and planting the Spike will award more. </p>
            
            <p class="article-content">Currently, winning a round means that every player on that team will receive 3,000 Creds, and the losing team gets 1,900. If one team loses consecutively at two and three in a row, they’ll receive a bump to even out the odds a bit, but overall, the game rewards success and punishes failure. These numbers are subject to change however, since the game is still in beta. </p>
            
            <p class="article-content">As for what to buy, that’s going to take some trial and error. Many weapons are strikingly similar to CS:GO, so it’s best to experiment to find the best weapons for your own skill set. Don’t skimp out on shields each round, but again, experiment to see if light or heavy are adequate for your playstyle.  </p>
            
            <img class="article-image" src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/valorant-image-3.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5">

            <h3 class="subtitle">Agent Abilities</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">Here is where VALORANT deviates strongly in theme from CS:GO and ventures into Overwatch territory. Each character, known as an Agent, has their own backstory with abilities that border on the supernatural to match their personality. Phoenix, unsurprisingly, is all about fire and the potential ability to respawn when eliminated. </p>
            
            <p class="article-content">Each Agent has a total of four abilities: one is a Signature Ability that is free each round, two others that must be purchased but can overlap rounds if not used, and one Ultimate ability that is progressively charged up through eliminations. Both the Signature and Ultimate abilities draw the comparison to Overwatch, since that is how all characters operate in that game. </p>
            
            <p class="article-content">Because each Agent has a theme to their abilities, it’s again best to learn a few different characters and become proficient in what they have to offer a team. Trying to main a single Agent will be problematic unless playing on a five-person premade team; The best solo ranked players will be flexible enough to provide their teammates with what is needed. There also has been no official plans to ban Agents in ranked play, however this is something players should expect in the future as Riot Games ramps up its esports presence for VALORANT.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Map Awareness Is Key</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">There are currently three maps in the closed beta: Haven, Bind, and Split. The objectives and core gameplay elements are consistent throughout, and so the bottom line here is that players who want to become their best in VALORANT must learn them inside and out. Click here to visit blitz.gg, with highly detailed images of each map and the names of key areas. It won’t be of much use if someone calls for defense of B Door outside B-Box and another player has no idea where that is. </p>
        
            <img class="article-image" src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/valorant-map.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5">
            
            <h3 class="subtitle">Running Is Loud, Walking Is Silent</h3>

            <p class="article-content">Here is the biggest mistake new players are making, particularly those who come from Overwatch compared to CS:GO. It takes a short moment to be eliminated in a round and running causes so much noise that you might as well yell loudly that you’re inbound to the opposing team. </p>
                        
            <p class="article-content">This means that walking is (almost) always the best idea. An Agent keeps their position obscured, and since there are no heavy footsteps, players are free to listen to other important audio cues made by the opposing team. Weapon accuracy is also vastly improved when standing still. </p>
                                    
            <p class="article-content">With that being said, running has its uses when no one else is around, to help allies, and a fun strategy that is by no means competitive is to designate a player as the loud runner, one who has no intention of actually fighting the opposing team. This player only serves to lot of noise while the rest of the team tries to catch the enemy off guard. It does not work often, but it’s a lot of fun.  </p>
