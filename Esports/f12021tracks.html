            <img class="entry-thumbnail" src="images/top-left.png">
            <p class="article-content">The new F1 2021 game is speeding towards its release date.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Codemasters has lifted the curtain on some details of the game, including what tracks will be available in the official Formula 1 game.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Thanks to covid, the F1 calendar has been a fluid and ever-changing thing which certainly makes life difficult for Coders.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">So what circuits will they have on offer for players in F1 2021?</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Latest news – Istanbul Park returns (again)</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">The vacant weekend left by the withdrawal of Singapore this year has been filled by a visit to the always wonderful Istanbul Park.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">Running from 1-3 October, the Turkish Grand Prix will form the second race of a triple-header that now sees the teams go from Sochi in Russia, across to Turkey, and then all the way out to Japan!</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">While the Turkish GP is a great addition for fans, it won’t be in the F1 2021 game.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subtitle">New tracks DLC</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">Because of all the calendar changes, the exact 2021 calendar of tracks will not be available straight off the bat for players.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">However, in a free post-launch DLC Codemasters will be providing Imola, Portimao, and Jeddah for players.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">How these then integrate with Career Mode or My Team saves that are already underway isn’t quite clear. Both modes will have a full, medium, and short-season option, but word on a fully-customisable calendar has not yet come through.</p>
          
            <h3 class="subtitle">China included</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">The vacant weekend left by the withdrawal of Singapore this year has been filled by a visit to the always wonderful Istanbul Park.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">However, Codemasters had already created their Braking Point story, which included the Chinese Grand Prix.</p>

            <p class="article-content">As a result, China will be in F1 2021, just not in the usual way. It won’t be present in the Season 1 calendar of My Team or Career Mode. However, from Season 2 and beyond it will be.</p>

            <p class="article-content">It will also be immediately raceable on Time Trial and Multiplayer, meaning you can get it into your League right away.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Short tracks</h3>
            
            <p class="article-content">While unconfirmed, we expect the four short variants to once again be present in F1 2021.</p>
            
            <p class="article-content">That’s Bahrain, Great Britain, USA, and Japan.</p>
