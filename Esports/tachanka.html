            <img class="entry-thumbnail" src="images/right-1.jpg">
            <p class="article-content">Lord Tachanka is an ironic nickname given to the playable Defending Operator character in the first-person tactical shooter game Rainbow Six Siege, who many fans considered to be poorly designed and under-powered upon release.</p>

            <p class="article-content">On December 1st, 2015, the video game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege was released by Ubisoft. In the game, the character Tachanka is available. Upon its release, many players noted that Tachanka's ability would need to be improved in order to make him a viable character.</p>

            <p class="article-content">The reasoning behind "Lord Tachanka" comes from the fact, that any player that plays as him is usually assured death. This is due to Tachanka's ability which is using a deployable mounted RP-46 Degtyaryov machine gun. Which many players found extremely lackluster and under-powered. Which using would cause a player to die frequently from enemy players.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Another reason is due to how other operators, other than Tachanka get buffs. Which has led to an outcry in the community of why Tachanka isn't getting reworked first due to how tremendously under-powered he is, which has led to Tachanka having the lowest pick rate of any character in the entire game</p>

            <p class="article-content">On April 6th, 2016, YouTuber GavinAcity uploaded a video titled "Why You Should Use Tachanka in Rainbow Six Siege," which provided an overview of the character's abilities.</p>

            <p class="article-content">On August 6th, Redditor SikorskyUH60 submitted a post asking about the "Lord Tachanka" meme to /r/OutOfTheLoop, where Redditor Your401kplan noted he was a popular ironic "circlejerking" subject in Rainbow Six online communities. On September 1st, YouTuber Matimi0 uploaded a Rainbow Six gameplay video titled "Lord Tachanka â€“ Rainbow Six Siege," featuring a montage of impressive kills executed with the character . On September 10th, YouTuber The Chanka posted an edited scene from the film Kick Ass in which Tachanka is shown shooting a room full of enemies while flying on a jetpack.</p>

            <p class="article-content">On September 25th, Redditor capt_GreenSparks posted a Tachanka-themed mobile phone wallpaper to /r/Rainbow6, captioned with the phrase "How Do You Buff A God?" . Within 72 hours, the post garnered more than 1,100 votes (89% upvoted) and 50 comments.</p>
